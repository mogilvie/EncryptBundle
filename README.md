# SpecShaper Encrypt Bundle

A bundle to handle encoding and decoding of parameters using OpenSSL and Doctrine lifecycle events.

Features include:
- V4 is will be Symfony 7 PHP 8.2
- V3 is Symfony 5.4|6 PHP 8. I'm moving my projects to symfony 7 so will not maintain after this v3.2.
- V2 is Symfony 5 not maintained.
- v1 is Symfony 3.4 not maintained.
- Uses OpenSSL
- Uses Lifecycle events

Features road map:

- [x] Create a factory method to expand for different encryptors
- [x] Create a twig function to decrypt encoded values
- [x] Expand parameters to allow selection of encoding method
- [x] Create CLI commands to encrypt and decrypt the entire database
- [ ] Handle DateTime data types via the bundle.

## About

EncryptBundle has been written for the [Parolla Plugins](https://plugins.parolla.ie) and [Parolla](https://www.parolla.ie) websites
to encode users private data. The bundle is expanded in a larger [gdpr-bundle](https://github.com/mogilvie/GdprBundle).

## Reporting an issue or a feature request

Issues and feature requests are tracked in the [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/mogilvie/HelpBundle/issues).

When reporting a bug, it may be a good idea to reproduce it in a basic project
built using the [Symfony Standard Edition](https://github.com/symfony/symfony-standard)
to allow developers of the bundle to reproduce the issue by simply cloning it
and following some steps.

# Installation

## Step 1: Install from package

Open a command console, enter your project directory and execute the
following command to download the latest development version of this bundle:

```
$ composer require specshaper/encrypt-bundle dev-master
```

This command requires you to have Composer installed globally, as explained
in the [installation chapter](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)
of the Composer documentation.

## Step 2: Enable the bundle

The receipe will create a package config file under config/packages/spec_shaper_encrypt.yaml.

If required, enable the bundle by adding it to the list of registered bundles
in the `config/bundles.php` file of your project:

```php
<?php

return [
    ...
    SpecShaper\EncryptBundle\SpecShaperEncryptBundle::class => ['all' => true],
];

```

## Step 2: Configure the bundle

Generate a 256-bit key using the command provided in the bundle.

```
$ bin/console encrypt:genkey
```
 
Copy the key into your .env file.
```
###> encrypt-bundle ###
SPEC_SHAPER_ENCRYPT_KEY= change_me!
###< encrypt-bundle ###
```

Maker will have created a packages yaml file. The key is resolved in there.

```yaml
# app/config/packages/spec_shaper_encrypt.yaml
spec_shaper_encrypt:
  encrypt_key: '%env(SPEC_SHAPER_ENCRYPT_KEY)%'
  is_disabled: false # Turn this to true to disable the encryption.
  connections:   # Optional, define the connection name(s) for the listener
    - 'default'
    - 'tenant'
  listener_class: App\EventListener\MyCustomListener # Optional to override the bundle Doctrine event listener.
  encryptor_class: App\Encryptors\MyCustomEncryptor # Optional to override the bundle OpenSslEncryptor.
  annotation_classes: # Optional to override the default annotation/Attribute object.
    - App\Annotation\MyAttribute
```

You can disable encryption by setting the 'is_disabled' option to true. Decryption still continues if any values
contain the \<ENC> suffix.

You can extend the EncryptBundle default Listener and override its methods. Use the 'listener_class' option
to point the bundle at your custom listener.

If you want to define your own annotation/attribute, then this can be used to trigger encryption by adding the annotation 
class name to the 'annotation_classes' option array.

You can pass the class name of your own encyptor service using the optional encryptorClass option.

### Alternative EncryptKeyEvent
The EncryptKey can be set via a dispatched event listener, which overrides any .env or param.yml defined key.
Create a listener for the EncryptKeyEvents::LOAD_KEY event and set your encryption key at that point.

## Step 3: Create the entities
Add the Encrypted attribute class within the entity.

```php
<?php
...
use SpecShaper\EncryptBundle\Annotations\Encrypted;
```

Add the attribute #[Encrypted] to the properties you want encrypted.

Note that the legacy annotation '@Encrypted' in the parameters is deprecated and
will be discontinued in the next major update.
```php
<?php

    /**
     * A PPS number is always 7 numbers followed by either one or two letters.
     * 
     * @ORM\Column(type="string")
     */
    #[Encrypted]
    protected string $taxNumber;
    
    /**
     * True if the user is self employed.
     * 
     * @ORM\Column(type="string", nullable=true)
     */
    #[Encrypted]
    protected ?bool $isSelfEmployed;
    
    /**
     * Date of birth
     * 
     * @Encrypted
     * Note that the above Encrypted property is a legacy annotation, and while
     * it still is supported, it will be deprecated in favour of Attributes.
     * 
     * @ORM\Column(type="string", nullable=true)
     */
    protected ?String $dob;
   
```
Where encrypting a field you will need to set the column type as string.  

Your getters and setters may also need to be type declared.  

For example, boolean should either be return declared bool, or return a bool using a ternary method.  

```php
<?php
    /**
     * Get isSelfEmployed
     *
     * @return boolean
     */
    public function isSelfEmployed(): bool
    {
        return $this->isSelfEmployed;
    }

    /**
     * Get isSelfEmployed
     *
     * @return boolean
     */
    public function isSelfEmployed(): bool
    {
        return ($this->isSelfEmployed == 1 ? true: false);
    }

```

For DateTime parameters store the date as a string, and use the getters and setters
to convert that string.

You may also need to create a DataTransformer if you are using the parameter in a form
with the DateType form type.

## Step 4: General Use

The bundle comes with an DoctrineEncryptListener. This listener catches the doctrine events
onLoad, onFlush and postFlush.

The onLoad event listener will decrypt your entity parameter at loading. This means that your forms
and form fields will already be decrypted.

The onFlush and postFlush event listeners will check if encryption is enabled, and encrypt the data
before entry to the database.

So, in normal CRUD operation you do not need to do anything in the controller for encrypting or decrypting
the data.

## Step 5: Decrypt in services and controllers

You can of course inject the EncryptorInterface service any time into classes
either by using autowiring or defining the injection in your service definitions.

```php
<?php
    use SpecShaper\EncryptBundle\Encryptors\EncryptorInterface;
    ...
    /**
     * @var SpecShaper\EncryptBundle\Encryptors\EncryptorInterface;
     */
    private $encryptor;
    ...
    
    // Inject the Encryptor from the service container at class construction
    public function __construct(EncryptorInterface $encryptor)
    {
        $this->encryptor = $encryptor;
    }
    
    // Inject the Encryptor in controller actions.
    public function editAction(EncryptorInterface $encryptor)
    {
        ...
        // An example encrypted value, you would get this from your database query.
        $encryptedValue = "3DDOXwqZAEEDPJDK8/LI4wDsftqaNCN2kkyt8+QWr8E=<ENC>";
        
        $decrypted = $encryptor->decrypt($encryptedValue);
        ...
    }


```

Or you can dispatch the EncryptEvent.

```php
<?php
    ...
    use SpecShaper\EncryptBundle\Event\EncryptEvent;
    use SpecShaper\EncryptBundle\Event\EncryptEvents;
    use Symfony\Component\EventDispatcher\EventDispatcherInterface;
    ...
    
    public function indexAction(EventDispatcherInterface $dispatcher)
    {
        ...
        // An example encrypted value, you would get this from your database query.
        $event = new EncryptEvent("3DDOXwqZAEEDPJDK8/LI4wDsftqaNCN2kkyt8+QWr8E=<ENC>");

        $dispatcher->dispatch(EncryptEvents::DECRYPT, $event);
        
        $decrypted = $event->getValue();
    }
```

## Step 5: Decrypt in templates

If you query a repository using a select with an array result 
then the doctrine onLoad event listener will not decrypt any encrypted
values.

In this case, use the twig filter to decrypt your value when rendering.

```
{{ employee.bankAccountNumber | decrypt }}
```

# Commands

You have already seen the command to generate a encryption key:
```
$ bin/console encrypt:genkey
```

You can decrypt/encrypt the entire database using the following
```
$ bin/console encrypt:database decrypt connection
```

The requried argument should be decrypt or encrypt.

There is an option to define the database connection if you employ multiple connections in your application.
